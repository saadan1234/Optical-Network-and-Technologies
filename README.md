# GSNR Prediction with Deep Learning

## Repository Overview
This repository contains implementations of deep learning models used for **GSNR (Generalized Signal-to-Noise Ratio)** prediction. The research was conducted at the **Optical Networks and Technologies Lab** in Islamabad, Pakistan, from **May 2024 to August 2024**. The primary goal was to develop highly efficient models to predict GSNR values while minimizing the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, achieving an accuracy of less than **0.01 MSE units**.

### Key Highlights:
- **Project Duration**: May 2024 - August 2024
- **Research Lab**: Optical Networks and Technologies Lab, Islamabad
- **Objective**: Predict GSNR values using deep learning models with enhanced accuracy.
- **Techniques**: Transfer Learning, Active Learning, Federated Learning, and Knowledge Distillation.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Interpretation of model predictions using SHAP, LIME, ICE, and PDP plots.
